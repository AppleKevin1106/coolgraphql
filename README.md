# Cool QL COOL

CoolQLCool (CQC) is an open source Graph QL server that allows you to turn websites into a Graph QL api. You can play around with it in [GraphiQL](https://cool.coolql.cool/graphiql).

Important pieces of code are in `schema/`. Inside of `schema/element.js` is the schema for grabbing element information from pages. Inside of `schema/parse.js` is the schema for specifying which site you want to query.

All fields have a description alongside the function for determining what to return. If you have any questions on what a field returns feel free to make an issue and I can explain further what it does.
